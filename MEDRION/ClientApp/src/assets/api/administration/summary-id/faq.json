    "faq": "Who can apply for expanded access?",
    "answer": "A patient with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment should discuss expanded access with their physician. It is important to note that individual patients are NOT able to apply for expanded access themselves. Only a licensed physician who is overseeing the patientâ€™s care may do so."
