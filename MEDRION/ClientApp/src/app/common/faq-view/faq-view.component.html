        <mdb-accordion-item-head>What is a "sponsor-investigator"? Isn't Alpha Scientific the sponsor?
        </mdb-accordion-item-head>
        <mdb-accordion-item-body>
          A sponsor-investigator is a single individual or institution/foundation etc. (where permitted) that is
          responsible for fulfilling the obligations of both a study sponsor and an investigator.
          <br>
          The sponsor's role is not related to financial support, which is provided by a funding agency.
          <br>
          Roles and responsibilities in the ISR Program:
          <br>
          Funding Agency, Alpha Pharma Scientific: Provides financial support/product for the study according to a
          defined Research Contract, which outlines milestones and specific deliverables
          Sponsor, Physician/Institution: Oversees the conduct of the study, including document management, data
          management, data analysis, publication, FDA reporting, etc.
          Investigator, Physician: Conduts the day-to-day research according to a defined protocol and per specified
          procedures

      <mdb-accordion-item>
        <mdb-accordion-item-head>Is the program appropriate for me?</mdb-accordion-item-head>
        <mdb-accordion-item-body>
          The program supports unsolicited, investigator-sponsored trials. This means that as the sponsor, you are
          entirely responsible for protocol design, statistical analysis, study registration, IRB (or local equivalent)
          approval, reporting of adverse events, and other sponsor responsibilities.
          <br>
          You will need a working knowledge of study design and management as well as applicable regulations for
          conducting research and good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines.
          <br>
          You will also need to ensure you have the resources available to conduct the trial (eg, personnel, equipment,
          time). For more information, visit www.fda.gov.

      <mdb-accordion-item>
        <mdb-accordion-item-head>Can the Research Committee or other Scientific experts help me develop a protocol,
          statistical analysis plan, etc?</mdb-accordion-item-head>
        <mdb-accordion-item-body>
          No. As part of the legal requirements, investigator-sponsored trials must be ""unsolicited."" Alpha Pharma
          Scientific is allowed to post generalized areas of interest but cannot participate in study concept generation
          or protocol development.
          <br>
          Once the protocol is developed, the committee may ask questions to clarify the design or may offer general
          advice if the proposal needs more structure.
          <br>
          However, you must maintain your role as the author and owner of the project.

      <mdb-accordion-item>
        <mdb-accordion-item-head>Who owns the data after the study has closed?</mdb-accordion-item-head>
        <mdb-accordion-item-body>
          In most cases, unless otherwise specified, you or your facility will own the data.
          <br>
          Can the ISR Program manage a database for my research, run the statistical analysis, or participate in
          drafting
          of publications?
          <br>
          No. Alpha Pharma Scientific cannot manage the study nor participate in data collection or analysis.
        </mdb-accordion-item-body>
      </mdb-accordion-item>

      <mdb-accordion-item>
        <mdb-accordion-item-head>Can Alpha Pharma Scientific control or prevent me from publishing results?
        </mdb-accordion-item-head>
        <mdb-accordion-item-body>
          No, Alpha Pharma Scientific would not delay or halt publication of results.
          <br>
          To protect intellectual property, you will be required to submit a draft prior to submission to a third
          party
          so Alpha Pharma Scientific can request reasonable redrafting if proprietary information is revealed.

      <mdb-accordion-item>
        <mdb-accordion-item-head>What happens if my study is not progressing as originally anticipated?
        </mdb-accordion-item-head>
        <mdb-accordion-item-body>
          If your study falls behind, requiring additional time, additional funding, or protocol changes, you will be
          asked to describe what has caused the change and what you believe can be done to get the project back on
          track.
          <br>
          The Divisional Research Committees will review the proposed changes and work with you to make a decision on
          remedial action.
          <br>
          Because study progress is documented in the research contract, an amendment is generally required.
