Subjects with no prior SREs are not permitted. \\\n- Subjects must be on therapy with bisphosphonates or denosumab for at least 1 month before start of study treatment. \\\n- Adequate hematological, liver and kidney function",

Chemotherapy administered for adjuvant/neo adjuvant disease is acceptable provided it was administered at least 1 year prior to study entry. - Subjects who received prior treatment or are already receiving everolimus treatment prior to study entry are not eligible. - Subjects with known or history of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease: subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a contrast CT scan or MRI of the brain within 28 days prior to randomization to exclude active brain metastasis.
